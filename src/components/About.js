    <h2>How we Stared our journey?</h2>
    <p>My interest in collecting shoes from earlier encouraged me to make something or provide platform for those also who are fond of checking out and collection shoes like me. I thought why don't I make a web application which i can host for users from where they can list of shoes and as a upcoming feature, they will be able to make a cart for their selected shoes and purchase it.</p>
